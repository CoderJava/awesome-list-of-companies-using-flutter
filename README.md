# Companies using Flutter List 


A shinny curated list of companies that use [flutter](https://flutter.dev) in their stack and may be hiring.


The general idea is to include tech companies that use Flutter in their stack. Some companies use only Flutter, and some use only on internal projects. 

For this first version of this list I decided to go against the usual and instead of putting the list here on Github, I chose to use *Notion* to host it, because it's better for you to filter and search 🕵️‍♀️ for exactly what you are looking for. In the future I may duplicate the list content here so I can accept Pull Requests.

Contributions are welcome, if you want to add or update any of the infos there, create an issue and I will update it ASAP.
